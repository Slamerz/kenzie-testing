Overview
You will create a single web page, with a labelled heading for each individual kata followed by your solution. For these katas, instead of using console.log() or document.write(), you are required to insert your results into the HTML using the document.createElement() and node.appendChild() methods.

The easiest way to get started is by copying the example file from Mini-Lesson: Inserting new Elements within a Page. You can copy and paste from the code embedded in the lesson.

You can keep adding each new kata onto the bottom of that page.

Several of the katas will use the following sample array, which you can copy and paste into your code:

const sampleArray = [469, 755, 244, 245, 758, 450, 302, 20, 712, 71, 456, 21, 398, 339, 882, 848, 179, 535, 940, 472]; 
Note that the first 10 katas should seem familiar: they are a repeat of the ones you did in Assessment: Javascript Katas 1. This time you will be inserting the results into your HTML page rather than simply logging them to the console.

Katas
1Display the numbers from 1 to 20. (1, 2, 3, ...,19, 20)
2Display the even numbers from 1 to 20. (2, 4, 6, ..., 18, 20)
3Display the odd numbers from 1 to 20. (1, 3, 5, ..., 17, 19)
4Display the multiples of 5 up to 100. (5, 10, 15, ..., 95, 100)
5Display the square numbers (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. up to 100. (1, 4, 9, ..., 81, 100)
6Display the numbers counting backwards from 20 to 1. (20, 19, 18, ..., 2, 1)
7Display the even numbers counting backwards from 20. (20, 18, 16, ..., 4, 2)
8Display the odd numbers from 20 to 1, counting backwards. (19, 17, 15, ..., 3, 1)
9Display the multiples of 5, counting down from 100. (100, 95, 90, ..., 10, 5)
10Display the square numbers, counting down from 100. (100, 81, 64, ..., 4, 1)
11Display the 20 elements of sampleArray. (469, 755, 244, ..., 940, 472)
12Display all the even numbers contained in sampleArray. (244, 758, 450, ..., 940, 472)
13Display all the odd numbers contained in sampleArray. (469, 755, 245, ..., 179, 535)
14Display the square of each element in sampleArray. (219961, 570025, ..., 222784)
15Display the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 20.
16Display the sum of all the elements in sampleArray.
17Display the smallest element in sampleArray.
18Display the largest element in sampleArray.
19Display 20 solid gray rectangles, each 20px high and 100px wide.
20Display 20 solid gray rectangles, each 20px high, with widths ranging evenly from 105px to 200px (remember #4, above).
21Display 20 solid gray rectangles, each 20px high, with widths in pixels given by the 20 elements of sampleArray.
22As in #21, but alternate colors so that every other rectangle is red.
23As in #21, but color the rectangles with even widths red. 
Bonus
If you would like an additional challenge, try completing each of the above again without using any for or while loops.
