Instructions to Run Tests (with Katas1 as example assignment)

1.  Run `npm install --global git+https://github.com/jragard/kenzie-testing`
2.  To test local file, the file should be named according to assignment instructions (e.g. katas1.js).  Then run `kenzie-test katas1` (or appropriate assignment name)
3. To test a completed assignment from a github or gitlab link, run `kenzie-test katas1 -g https://github.com/jragard/katas1` (or whatever the submitted github or gitlab link happens to be)
