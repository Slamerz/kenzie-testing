# Katas 1 Tests

Each kata has one 'describe' statement with 2-3 tests in test/katas1test.js - one test is for the correct answer we are expecting, and the other tests are for common incorrect answers (for example, if the instructions call for returning an array of the numbers 1 - 20, but the function returns 1 - 21, a test looking for that common mistake will be triggered, further automatically narrowing down the mistake.  Test messages can also be accessed, so this might come in handy later when we build a user interface with instant feedback)

# Katas 1 Instructions

For these particular tests to work, the wording of the instructions for the Katas 1 assessment will need to be slightly changed.  Below are the instructions I propose.

1.  Fill in the function named 'oneThroughTwenty' to return an array with the numbers from 1 to 20. (1, 2, 3,..., 19, 20)
2.  Fill in the function named 'evensToTwenty' to return an array with the even numbers from 1 to 20. (2, 4, 6,...18,20)
3.  Fill in the function named 'oddsToTwenty' to return an array with the odd numbers from 1 to 20. (1, 3, 5,...,17,19)
4.  Fill in the function named 'multiplesOfFive' to return an array with the multiples of 5 up to 100. (5, 10, 15, ..., 95, 100)
5.  Fill in the function named 'squareNumbers' to return an array with the square numbers up to 100. (1, 4, 9, ..., 81, 100)
6.  Fill in the function named 'countingBackwards' to return an array with the numbers counting backwards from 20 to 1. (20, 19, 18, ..., 2, 1)
7.  Fill in the function named 'evenNumbersBackwards' to return an array with the even numbers counting backwards from 20. (20, 18, 16, ..., 4, 2)
8.  Fill in the function named 'oddNumbersBackwards' to return an array with the odd numbers from 20 to 1, counting backwards. (19, 17, 15, ..., 3, 1)
9.  Fill in the function named 'multiplesOfFiveBackwards' to return an array with the multiples of 5, counting down from 100. (100, 95, 90, ..., 10, 5)
10.  Fill in the function named 'squareNumbersBackwards' to return an array with the square numbers, counting down from 100. (100, 81, 64, ..., 4, 1)
