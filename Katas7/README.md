# Katas 7 Tests

Each kata has one 'describe' statement with 3 tests in test/katas7test.js - one is testing to make sure the built-in method isn't used in the student's function, one is testing to verify that the callback function is being called for each element in the given array, and one is testing to verify the expected answer/result.

# Katas 7 Instructions

I think the instructions for this particular assignment are fine as is.  The instructions simply call for the student to reproduce the behavior of a given list of array methods with their own functions, without using Javascript's built-in versions.
